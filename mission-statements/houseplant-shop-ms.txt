"Our founders started out as a group of childhood friends that all had a passion for nature and
the outdoors. Post college, they ended up becoming roommates. Turns out, having a home filled with plants
was something they continued to have in common. Unfortunately, they found it difficult to find a place
online to purchase houseplants that was easy to navigate and wasnâ€™t just geared to wholesale. So, in 2017,
they decided to launch HousePlantShop.com to be the ultimate destination for everything houseplants."
